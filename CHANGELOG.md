# Changelog

All notable changes to Tonal. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## Unreleased

### Added
- Playback restarts by itself if mpv crashes, up to three times a minute.
- Settings → YouTube → yt-dlp → Update, to update the bundled yt-dlp from inside the app.
- YouTube uses Deno, Node.js or Bun for yt-dlp's JavaScript challenges when one is installed.
- Third-party notices, with mpv's license and source in the Windows downloads.

### Changed
- Lyrics follow the song: the current line stays centered, scrolling by hand pauses following for a few seconds, clicking a line jumps there, plain lyrics scroll as a page.

- The app code is split into smaller modules; test hooks are left out of release builds.
